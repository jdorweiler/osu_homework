Question 2
The trouble with binary search trees is that they can become unbalanced depending on the order that you
insert values. Give an order for inserting the values 1 through 7 such that the resulting tree is a full binary
search tree. This problem does not require you to fill in a tree, just write down the order in which you would
insert the values. (Hint: it might be helpful to first draw the full tree to figure out how the values must be
arranged, then you can determine the order to add them!
