6. How many ways are there to select five unordered elements from a set with three elements
when repetition is allowed?\\

There are r=5 slots and n=3 types to pick.  The total number of ways is C((5+2),5) = 21

8. How many different ways are there to choose a dozen donuts from the 21 varieties at a
donut shop?\\

There are r=12 slots and n = 21 types to choose.  The total number of ways is then C((12+20),12) = 25792840.  The same problem with out repition will have C(21,12) = 293930 ways.

12. How many different combinations of pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, and half dollars
can a piggy bank contain if it has 20 coins in it?

There are r=20 slots and n=5 types to pick.  The total number of ways is then C(24,20) = 10626.

14. How many solutions are there to the equation

$x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4 = 17$ where

$x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$ are nonnegative integers?
are nonnegative integers?

The number of slots is r=17 with n=4 types to choose.  That makes the total C(20,17) = 1140
