Question 1

i) $E(x) \land T(x)$

ii) You only eat food that tastes good and is not healthy.\\

Question 2

$P(x) \rightarrow Q(x)$ where $P(x)$ is the statement that the three integers are 

consecutive and $Q(x)$ is they are 

divisible by three.

Assume three consecutive integers $x, x+1, x+2$ then the sum of these integers 

is $3x+3$ which is always 

divisible by three:

\indent \indent \indent \indent \indent \indent\indent \indent $\displaystyle{\frac{3x+3}{3}} = x+1 $ 

This completes the proof.\\

Question 3

$((p \lor q) \land (\neg q \lor r)) \rightarrow (q \lor r)$

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c}
p & q & r & $\lnot q$ & $(p \lor q)$ (1) & $(\neg q \lor r)$ (2) & $1 \land 2$ (3) & $(q \lor r)$ (4)& $3 \rightarrow 4$ \\
\hline
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
Not a tautology\\

Question 4

They are associative \\

Question 5

Basis step: n = 0

$1+3(0) \leq 4^0$

$1 \leq 1$ so the basis step checks out.

Inductive step:

$1 + 3(k)+(k+1) \leq 4^{(k+1)}+(k+1)$

Since we are adding $k+1$ to each side we only need to show that:

$1+3(k) \leq 4^{(k+1)}$

Which is obvious since the left hand side will be negative for all n $\leq$ 0.\\ 
\newpage
\textbf{Question 6}\\

\textbf{Proof by induction:}

A single break for a bar of size $mn$ will produce two squares with size $m_1n_1$ 

and $m_2n_2$.  The sum of 

these squares equals the total size of the bar $mn = m_1n_1 + m_2n_2$ so each 

break produces $mn+1$ bars 

and proves that for $mn$ breaks we only need $mn-1$ breaks in the bar.\\

Question 7

I have no idea I can't see any of the summations on blackboard!
