Question 1:
a. $a_n = 5n-10$ recursive def: $a_{n+1} = 5(n+1)-10$ 

= $a_{n+1} = a_n+5$ \\

b. $a_n = n^2 -n$  = $a_{n+1} = (n+1)^2-(n+1)$ = $n^2+2n+1-n+1 $

$= n^2-n+2n$ = $a_{n+1} = a_n + 2n$\\

question 2:

a. $S = \{x | x > 6 \,and\, odd\}$

Basis: $7 \in S$

Recursive: if $x \in S$ then $x+2 \in S$\\

b. $S = \{ \lambda | length(\lambda) = even\}$ 

Basis: $\lambda = 0 ,0 \in S$ this holds since 0 is even.

Recursive: if $\lambda \in S$ then $\lambda +2 \in S$\\

Question 3:

Basis step: This holds for the basis step since $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$ both give a+b 

= odd.\\

Recursive step: 
suppose that a+b=k where k is an odd integer, then a+b=2k+1. 

 (a+1)+(b+1)= 2k+1 = a+b+2 = 2k+1 

= a+b=2k+3 = a+b=2(k+1)+1 which shows that a+b is always an odd 

integer. \\


Question 5:

a. You need to pick at least 9 balls

b. 10 red + 20 green + 20 yellow = 50 balls + 3 blue.  So you would need 

to pick 53
